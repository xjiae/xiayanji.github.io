Welcome!

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate studying Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am advised by [Prof. Insup Lee](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml) and [Prof. Oleg Sokolsky](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sokolsky/). I am broadly interested in:

- Anomaly Detection
- Cyber-physical Systems
- Explainable Machine Learning
- Machine Learning for Healthcare
